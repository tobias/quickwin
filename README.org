* Quickwin

A fuzzy matching window switcher built with [[https://fennel-lang.org/][fennel]] and [[https://www.gtk.org/][gtk+]]. There are
many like it, but this one is mine.

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with Lua 5.1.

** Installation

You'll need to install:
+ A few debs:
  - ~luarocks~: to install lua packages
  - ~libxmu-dev~: needed to build ~xctrl~
  - ~libdbus-glib-1-dev~: to install ~ldbus~
  All together: ~apt install luarocks libxmu-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev~
+ Some lua packages:
  - ~luarocks install fennel~: the fennel language
  - ~luarocks install stdlib~: nice lua addons
  - ~luarocks install lgi~: bindings to GObject/GTK and friends
  - ~luarocks install lualanes~: threading for lua
+ [[https://github.com/tobias/xctrl/][My fork]] of ~xctrl~ (to allow multiple connections to XWindows per process):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:tobias/xctrl.git~
cd xctrl
make install EXTRA_CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/lua5.1 -fPIC" EXTRA_LDFLAGS="-Wl,--no-as-needed"
#+END_SRC

** Setup

You'll need to bind it to a keybinding - I use ~alt+tab~ to replace the default switcher.
